Just a few toy programs I'm making as I learn Go. 

Each one is designed to "teach" me a separate aspect of the language. For example, `primes` helps me figure out how simple math works in Go.

It was also an opportunity to test various keys (GPG for signed commits, SSH push access, etc.) without blowing up a [Stellar](https://github.com/stellar) repository.
